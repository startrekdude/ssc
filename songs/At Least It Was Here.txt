Give me your hands
Show me the door
I cannot stand to wait anymore
Somebody said
Be what you be
We could be old and cold and dead on the sea

But I love you more than words can say
I can't count the reasons I should stay

Give me some rope
Tie me to dream
Give me the hope to run out of steam
Somebody said
It could be here
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year

I can't count the reasons I should stay
One by one they all just fade away

I'm tired of the wait and sees
I'm tired of that part of me
That makes up a perfect lie
To keep us busy
But hours turn into days
So watch what you throw away
And be here to recognize
There's another way

Give me some rope
Tie me to dream
Give me the hope to run out of steam
Somebody said
It could be here
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year

But I love you more than words can say
I can't count the reasons I should stay
One by one they all just fade away
Though I love you more than words can say
