All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand
In California with my toes in the sand

Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck, and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh-h

He knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No

Cause it's too cold, woah-oh, for you here
And now
So let me hold, woah-oh, both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to race
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue cause you love the taste, yeah

These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't want to tell you about
No, no, no

Cause it's too cold, woah-oh, for you here
And now
So let me hold, woah-oh, both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Cause it's too cold, woah-oh, for you here
And now
So let me hold, woah-oh, both your hands in the holes of my sweater



Cause it's too cold, woah-oh, for you here
And now
So let me hold, woah-oh, both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Cause it's too cold, woah-oh for you
And now
Let me hold, woah-oh, both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold
It's too co-old
The hands of my sweater
