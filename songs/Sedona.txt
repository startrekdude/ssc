The red sandstone it fell
Right smack on top of Sedona Arabella
The Jon boats said won't you hop on in
And the stagecoach baby gonna take you for a spin, oh oh, oh oh

Well hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script, you shot the plot
I remember, I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink
A Saturday night kind of pink

The black list and it's hosts
You came down so swift, and you drove 'em to the coast
We're going California but we're all out of work
I guess that's better than a grave and a hearse, oh oh, oh oh

Hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script, you shot the plot
I remember, I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink
A Saturday night kind of pink

Yeah the devils in a rush
And his duct tape makes you hush
Hey there Sedona let me cut you a deal
I'm a little hung over and I may have to steal your soul oh oh, oh oh

Hey Little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script, and you shot the plot
I remember, I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink (So bright and pink)
A Saturday night kind of pink
