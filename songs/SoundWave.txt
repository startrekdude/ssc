Come around, come around make a wall of thunder
Be a spark in the dark, a tidal wave, dancing light
Build it up now, waiting for the drop is the wonder
Oh, what a sound, rainging down all around
You're a beautiful sight
Oh, hold on tight this only gets better
Oh, only you and I know how were gonna get there

Drowning in soudwave, no slowing down, sing go, go
Into the sunrays, no cooling down, sing no
Let's just keep going on
Let's just keep going

No comin' down, comin' down, the elevation
Say it loud to the crowd, our fire burns into the night
Turn it up now, sending only good vibrations
A whole wall of sound crashing down all around
What a beautiful life
Oh, hold on tight this only gets better
Oh, only you and I know how were gonna get there

Drowning in soudwave, no slowing down, sing go, go
Into the sunrays, no cooling down, say no
Let's just keep going on
Let's just keep going

Drowning in soudwave, no slowing down, sing go, go
Into the sunrays, no cooling down, sing no
Let's just keep going on
Let's just keep going
