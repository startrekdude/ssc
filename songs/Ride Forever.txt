Well I was born up north of Great Slave, 1898
And I rode near all my life, on a ranch near Devil's Gate
And I've seen this world about me, bend and flip and change
Hey, it feels like rain -- that's a thunder cloud
Well I've been called a coward, but I've seen two World Wars
And I lost my son Virgil, my Korean reward
And my Lucy died last summer -- you ask me if I cry?
Hell, I'll show you tears, they're all over this ground
They're falling from these blue Alberta skies

We're gonna ride forever
You can't keep horsemen in a cage
Should the angels call, well it's only then
We might pull in the reins

They tell me I'm an old man, they tell me I am blind
They took my driver's license, this house ain't far behind
I say jump back all you big suits 'cause you've got something wrong
I ain't gone, no I ain't gone
I am still breathing and I still have my pride
And I have my memories, your life it never dies
Like the wind that blows in thunder
Like the stallion on the fly, I got it all
And I'm standing tall
Underneath these blue Alberta skies

We're gonna ride forever
You can't keep horsemen in a cage
Should the angels call, well it's only then
We might pull in the reins

So I say to all you old men, don't let yourselves get broke
If you think the world's gone crazy
And it's scratching at your throat
It's time to dust off that old saddle, get it on a horse
Kick up your spurs, we're gonna run like stink
We're gonna tear across these blue Alberta skies

We're gonna ride forever
You can't keep horsemen in a cage
Should the angels call, well it's only then
We might pull in the reins.

We're gonna ride forever
You can't keep horsemen in a cage
Should the angels call, well it's only then
We might pull in the reins.

We're gonna ride forever
You can't keep horsemen in a cage
Should the angels call, well it's only then
We might pull in the reins.
