The prayers have been spoken
May the gods be on my side
May they join my way to bring me a victory
Seven at one stroke
My triumph and my pride
They will be history

But behind my enemy's eyes
A soul in disguise
Not only lies

We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide
We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide

What's hell without a paradise?
What's the night without a day?
We would think it's bright
What's a fall if we can't rise?
What's a hero at a play without a fool to fight?

But behind my enemy's eyes
A soul in disguise
Not only lies

We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide
We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide

But behind my enemy's eyes
A soul in disguise
Not only lies

We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide
We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide

We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide
We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide

We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide

We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide
